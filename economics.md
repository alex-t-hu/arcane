### Macro
GDP is total market value of all final goods and services
GDP = C + I + G + (X – M) (good market clearing condition)
- MPC heterogeneity leads to multiplier 1/(1-MPC) to be more than 1
GDP = 
- **Wages and Salaries:** Compensation for labor.
- **Rents:** Income from property.
- **Interest:** Earnings from investments.
- **Profits:** Corporate earnings.
GDP = value added at each stage of production (revenue - intermediate goods) = labor costs + profit

Aggregate demand vs Aggregate supply. x-axis is output/real GDP/ total demand. y-axis is price level. short-run aggregate-supply is upwards; Aggregate demand is downwards; long run aggregate-supply should be constant of price level. because the output is more than natural; firms and workers notice higher prices so SRAS shifts left/upward until natural output is reached again, but at a higher price level.

IS-LM is a purely demand based way of looking at things.
IS-curve (investment-savings) is nominal interest rate vs real output, and it is downward sloping. captures equilibrium in goods market. investment is a function of output and interest rate. expansionary fiscal policy like reduce taxes and increase spending will increase output.
LM-curve (liquidity-money) has to do with money supply and is upward-sloping or horizontal. real money demand $M^d=L(i,Y)=Y L(i)$, and supply fixed $M$ by central bank, so $M/P=YL(i)$ (using real units), in practice $M$ is adjusted to fix $i$ captures equilibrium in financial markets. the financial market equilibrium graph has nominal interest rate (people care about nominal interest rates when holding money) on y-axis and real output on x-axis. $M^s/P$ is graphed as a vertical line and $YL(i)$ is graphed as downward-sloping curve. expansionary monetary policy increases money supply with bonds/lowers interest rate
expansionary monetary policy increases $M$ to lower $i$ to account for an increased $Y$ 
$I=b_0+b_1Y-b_2(i-\pi^e +x)$ where $i$ is nominal interest rate, $\pi^e$ is expected inflation, $x$ is risk premium, $c_1+b_1<1$ normally

structural unemployment is natural unemployment. we assume a production function proportional to employment. the reservation wage is indifferent wage. workers have bargaining power.
wage-setting by workers, they have some notion of expected price level (W is aggregate nominal wage) $W=P^e/(1+u)$ 
price-setting by firms, firms try to mark-down wages from price level. $P=(1+m)W$ 
real wage y-axis, unemployment rate x-axis
phillips curve says inflation and unemployment have inverse relationship. inflation rate on y-axis and unemployment rate on x-axis. though, stagflation can occur. it can be derived by the above equations.
$\pi_t-\pi_t^e=-\alpha(u_t-u_n)$ and $Y_t=N_t=(1-u_t)\cdot L$ , so alternatively phillips curve can be change in inflation rate against output
Okun's law - 1% increase in unemployment will usually be associated with a 2% drop in gross domestic product (GDP)

expected present discounted value - value in the present of some future stuff. generally, we know the interest rate $i_{11}$ and have to estimate interest rate later $i_{1t}^e$ 
yield to maturity on a n-year bond is constant annual interest rate that makes today's bond price equal to PDV of future payments
default risk - bond issuer doesn't pay back full amount promised. price risk - uncertainty about price that bond is worth in future before maturity
permanent income hypothesis - ppl consume based on permanent income, average income over lifetime, temporary increase little effect
life-cycle hypothesis - ppl plan consumption and saving over entire life
in practice $C_t=C(TotalWealth_t, Y_t-T_t)$. financial wealth is assets minus debt (EPDV), human wealth is EPDV of labor income
investment depends on current and expected profits and current and expected real interest rates

$Y=F(K,N)$ growth is function of capital and N

## Psychology
### time preferences
exponential time discounting model because
positive time preference - prefer receiving goods or benefits sooner than later
consistency - preferences are consistent across time
diminishing marginal utility of consumption - each additional unit consumed provides less satisfaction than previous unit

Exponential discounters - Consistent and rational discounting over time. Commitment devices neither help nor harm them significantly because they plan and follow through consistently.
Naïve hyperbolic discounters - Unaware of their future self-control issues. Typically benefit from commitment devices as they help prevent impulsive decisions.
Sophisticated hyperbolic discounters - Fully aware of their future self-control issues. Use commitment devices to counteract anticipated self-control problems and thus benefit from them.
Partially sophisticated hyperbolic discounters - Partially aware of their future self-control problems. May incorrectly estimate their future behavior or the degree of self-control issues. These individuals can be harmed by commitment devices because they might misestimate their future preferences or constraints. They could overly restrict themselves and thus make worse-off decisions, harming their welfare.

### risk preferences
diminishing marginal utility of wealth
constant relative risk aversion utility function $u(c)=c^{1-\gamma}/(1-\gamma)$ , CARA $u(c) = e^{-\alpha c}/ \alpha$ 

alternatively, we have prospect theory. a reference point and the utility looks like a sigmoid passing thru the origin
- V(-x) < -V(x)
- endowment effect - ppl overvalue items they own compared to don't own
- rejection of small-scale gambles (-100 vs 110)
- housing market behavior - homeowners overprice houses relative to market conditions when selling
- marathon finisht imes - marathoners speedup before hitting a round-number goal

### social preferences
dictator - allocational decision affects themselves and others, give 1 cost x
ultimatum - proposer offers x to responder. responder knows x and total amount, accepts or rejects
trust - amount given to responder tripled
distributional preferences - represented purely in terms of amount of money (or other resources) people get
social-image concerns - ppl don't wanna look bad
intentions-based preferences - include reciprocity, procedural justice, and other facets of social preferences that imply ppl care abt how allocations came abt

### terms
**classical economics**
externalities
different private costs and benefits
risk aversion

**psychological**
present bias - people care abt present utilities more than anything that's not present
probability weighting - ppl dont use correct probs
social image concerns
trust - people trust differently
loss aversion - avoid loss than get gains
hard paternalism - prefer choosing outcome themselves
