>**holomorphic functions** 
 $f(x+iy)=u+iv$, $u_x=v_y,v_x=-u_y$

>in a metric space, $d: M\times M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ satisfies triangle inequality and positive definite 
>metric space $M$ is **bounded** if there exists constant $D$ with $d(p,q)\le D$ for all $p,q\in M$ 
>homeomorphism between $M$ and $N$ is a continuous bijection **and** inverse is continous
>sequence $x_1,\dots$ in metric space $M,d_M$ is **Cauchy** if for any $\epsilon>0$, $d_m(x_m,x_n)<\epsilon$ for sufficiently large $m,n$ . $\mathbb{Q}$ doesn't converge
>$M$ is **complete** if every cauchy sequence converges
>a set $U\subset M$ is **open** in $M$ if for each $p\in U$, some $r$-neighborhood is inside $U$ 
>$U$ is closed if $x_1,\dots$ converges to $x$ then $x\in M$ 

>**topological space** pair $(X,\mathcal{T})$ ; the topology contains open sets of $X$ including $\emptyset$ and $X$ , contains finite intersections of open sets and arbitrary unions (possibly infinite) of open sets are inside. redefine contunity as for any $f: X\rightarrow Y$  and open set $V\subseteq Y$ , $f^{-1}(V)$ is openset of $X$ 
>**separation axioms**
>- **T0(Kolmogorov)** - any 2 points has open set containing one point but not the other
>- **T1 (Frechet)** - each point has a neighborhood not containing the other
>- **T2 (Hausdorff)** - any points have disjoint neighborhoods
>- **T3 (Regular)** - for any point $p$ and closed set $C$ not containing it, can find disjoint open sets encompassing the two
>- **T4 (Normal)** - any disjoint closed sets can be separated by disjoint open sets
>- **T5 (completely normal)** - if $\overline{A}\cap B=A\cap \overline{B}=\emptyset$ , $A\subseteq U$ and $B\subseteq V$ for some open $U,V$

Two maps $f:X\to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$ are homotopy equivalent  if fg=gf=identity
