### History 
Both far-left and far-right of Germany are not fond of supporting Ukraine.
UK sort of not part of Europe; so is Bulgaria/Hungary/Russia/Turkey (Instanbul is cross-continental)
Roman empire, Hanseatic League, German confederation formed in 1871, Italy 
UN - sponsor of NGOs, peace-keeping forces, 3 UN cities Geneva, NYC, Vienna. live off dues, often withheld
EU - different kind of political entity
1945 - 1970, recovery and Cold War; 1970 - 1980, youth revolt and cold war, 1990 to today, fall of communism and attempt at unification
1957 Treaties of Rome created European Economic and Atomic energy community
George Bush & Iraq and its relationship to Europe
Pre WWII, German was dominant in scientist, then English
Heritage industries in Britain/France hid the bad past, in Germany Holocaust is like a wound


- What is the difference between the heritage industry of England and France? Was it that England seems to be erasing the bad parts of the past, while France focused on an idealistic view of itself?
- Jewish and Muslim people are hated on in Europe, but what about the other religions, such as Pagan religions?
- What role did the Czech republic play in European history, and why is Benes so important and we are reading his writing? 

The reading was stimulating, and it seems there's plenty of meaning in it that I do not understand.

Judt explores the idea of what Europe is. Europe seems to be full of dichotomies. East and West is one. The East is poorer and home of prostitution. The East is also more foreign, with Russia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria playing a liminal role in European history. The East is also associated with communism and the West with democracy. These border countries seem to struggle with finding a national identity, torn between trying to fit in with or not be a part of Europe. There's also the Christian vs non-Christian contrast. Muslims were considered uncivilized and outsiders. A large part of history was spent in wars between the Ottoman Islam empire and Christians in Europe. In modern European history, Turkey got rejected from the EU, and one of the reasons could be islamaphobiaâ€”the EU commissioner warned in 2004 of the 'Islamisation' of Europe.

Jude claims that differences between European countries may be smaller than differences within, which is ironic. The wealth gap in UK, Spain, and Italy between industrialized and rural regions grow from 1950s to 1990s. During 2000 only three of England's ten administrative regions exceeded the national average wealth per capita.

Somehow, English became the primary language. German and French used to be the dominant languages in the international scientific or scholarly community. But, after what Germany did in WWII, it seems that Germany's popularity decreased. As for French, it's crazy that in early 20th century, French was the language of European elites, spoken by people at Oxford. Judt seems to believe that French fell out of favor because of its declining international role, while English rose because of America.

Every European country seemed to experience nostalgia in late 20th-century. In eastern Europe, there was nostalgia for the positive aspects of communism. In western Europe, heritage industries, memorials, reconstructions, reenactments, and renovations flourished. It's fun to think about the large number of railroad museums in England. In France Mitterrand built many museums, memorials, burials, and things like the Grande Arche at La Defense, the graceful Pyramid at the Louvre and the modernist Opera House by the Bastille. While England seemed nostalgic for a fake past, France focused on a spiritual nostalgia. 

Anti-semitism existed previously due to scapegoating by white Europeans, but new anti-semitism emerged due to Muslim/Arab people and the Middle-eastern tensions.

##### Reflection
I was very surprised by the atrocities committed by the USSR to Germany. In prior history classes, my impression was that Nazi Germany was evil and everyone else united against it, but here it seems Judt draws some sympathy to Germany (or maybe, some sympathy relative to the evils of the USSR, which Judt highly emphasizes). The USSR people invaded Germany and other countries and did a lot of damage. The soldiers raped woman.

Another interesting discussion was about the creation of Israel. I believe it seems Israel was created after WWII as a safe haven for Jews, since no country wanted them and some people still wanted to kill them.

Another interesting point is about communism vs fascism. It seems they are both sides of the same coin. For example, previous Nazis become part of communist parties in Eastern Europe. It is a little scary that these people still exist.

There are some interesting interactions between Britain and the US post WWII. There was a transition in power dynamics, with US becoming dominant power and lending to Britain through the Marshall Act, and the British increasing debt post war. Also, the US culture seemed more exciting and liberal, and it got transferred to Britain through television. Initially, there was fear of losing culture and condecension, but nonetheless American culture got to Britain. Interestingly, the reading mentioned that the American film "Mrs Miniver (1942)" is one of the truest representation of British culture, depicting the Dunkirk situation. For some reason, British film industry did not develop as much. 

It is interesting to reflect on the changing views on immigration and how Europe has become increasingly liberal. For example, the UK used to have an empire, and post WWII it seems they got distracted and lost control over colonies. The people from colonies provided cheap labor, but initially Britain refused to let them come over, or seemed to give them very little rights, with like the Commonwealth Immigration act of 1962,. Compare that to now when there are lots of immigrants in Britain, and Britain seems to become more like the US.

Another interesting observation is that Germany, that is West Germany, was doing quite well after the War. In fact most of western Europe seemed to do well economically after the war. People had a lot of children, and a lot of the industrial infrastructure still remained. Probably though, America did the best post war, enabling America to become the world's super power.

1. why did the British film industry not really develop as much as Hollywood?
2. what changed British people's attitudes towards immigrations? what is responsible for Europe becoming more liberal over time?
3. how did Nazism develop? what does it mean when Judt says something about Churchill thinking it came from Prussia?

### Postwar
- EEC (European Economic Community) created by Treaty of Rome for economic integration
- lots of young ppl, and universities expanded
- liberated sexual style of Sixties
- Social Democratic Party and Christian Democratic Union parties in Western Germany
- Later, the Greens (pro-environment, young), Alternative for Germany (right win populist), Free Democratic Party. 1-issue parties.
- Helsinki accords recognized USSR land gains
- In Greece, Karamlis lost power
- In Spain, Franco was dictator, brutal but effective
- Britain reluctantly joined the Community?
- Argues that ppl who constructing Europe in 70s and 80s were "Provincial". Schengen Agreement enables free border movement.

The "Swinging Sixties" time period in UK was a liberal, youth-driven time. Post WWII, there were many babies. The young people enjoyed modernity and hedonism. The enjoyed art, music, fashion. The Beatles were created in 1960. The modernist subculture focusing on music (soul, rhythm and blues, jazz), fashion, and scooters. The rockers were a rival culture focusing on motorcycles and rock'n'roll. During the 1950s it was founded, post-war and motorcycles were available to young people. The term cafe racer emerged since bikers frequented these transport cafes. A famous motorcycle design would be the Triton, a combination of Triumph engines to Norton frames. Both subcultures were influenced by American music and films. Also, recreational drugs flourished, like LSD and marijuana. There was also protests against the Vietnam war. Sportswise, England won the 1966 World Cup. Fashionwise, the miniskirt and bobcut was created, and there were popular fashion models like Twiggy and shopping areas in King's Road, Kensington and Carnaby Street. In a sense, collective amnesia could be reflected through many ways in this culture. The use of drugs could be because people want to forget the horrifying past and simply be happy. The growth of music and fashion could also serve that purpose.

Reading about the Social Democratic Party and Christian Democratic Union parties in Western Germany was interesting because they're center-left and center-right, and how later on the Green party, AfD emerged is interesting to think about. Moreover, the reading mentioned that the center-right party in Germany had more woman holding power in it than men, or at least more relative to the center-left party, which is quite amazing. The Helsinki accords seemed quite interesting because it seemed to cement USSR's conquered territory, though the reading seems to suggest it wasn't that good for USSR in reality? Karamanlis's story of industrializing Greece, giving full voting rights to woman is quite inspiring, and how Greece transformed to a democracy afterwards and joined the EEC. The fact that Greece and many other European countries still had monarchies even in the 1960s is quite shocking to me. Another point that stood out was how Spain had a dictator called Franco, yet Franco seemed to be quite effective at managing Spain. This reminds me of China currently. I do think a dictatorship could be very effective depending on who the dictator is.

- How did Greece end up becoming a democracy, would it have been better off remaining a monarchy?
- Why did American culture like jazz affect British culture so much in the 1960s?
- Nowadays it seems men lean conservative and woman liberal, but in Germany during the 1960s, it appears to be flipped, why?

- Women's rights in the 50's. Feminism.
- environmentalism is on the right as well as left. first comes the eating, then comes morality
- communism was very hard to develop in the West because it was failing on the East
- The new democratic party has some more ideas like woman's rights, environmentalism, compared to the old democratic party.


### More post-war
- Interesting how religion transcends political regimes. In Poland catholicism was very powerful.
- Solidarity was a labor movement
- Soviets failed to conquer Afghanistan. 1/5 veterans were alcoholics.
- 1986 chernobyl exploded
- contradiction in Gorbachev's philosophy, like market-oriented economy while maintaining communism or allowing locals to do freedom of expression.
- poland had some democratic elections, and communists just let them win
- what, no clue that opening the wall led to downfall
- bulgaria hates turks
- "The opposite of Communism was not capitalism but Europe"

Gorbachev was a fascinating figure. His philosophy was contradictory, because he made USSR's economy more market-oriented and allowed locals to do freedom of expression, which led to the weakening of communism. He believed devoutly in "Leninist principles". He was also loved by Western European leaders. 

The solidarity movement in Poland was interesting, showing how communism got defeated. Communism didn't work, and this led to worker unrest and strikes. Also there was the added pressure of Catholicism and the Pope advocating against communism. 

It was interesting the reading mentioned Viktor Orban, who is now Prime Minister of hungary and somewhat autocratic. Back then, Orban was a fierce advocate against communism. Now, it seems like Hungary is quite close to being communist, as far right and far left is similar.

The reading mentioned "The Opposite of Communism was not capitalism but Europe". This shows the opposition movements to communism in these countries was also about embracing European identity, values, and integration. For example, Eastern European countries' opposition movements wanted to join the EU.

With regards to the Iron Curtain fall, the UK experienced optimism and apprehension. Many saw the geopolitical reorganization of Europe as an opportunity for enhanced trade and diplomatic relations, fostering hopes for a more unified and prosperous continent. But, there were fears about increased immigration and economic competition from Eastern Europe.

The 1990s, dubbed the "end of history" by some commentators, had widespread belief that liberal democracy had triumphed, so people thought there would be lasting global peace and stability. But also there were still underlying tensions and conflicts, such as the UK grappling with its national identity within a rapidly integrating Europe, igniting debates over sovereignty and the extent of involvement in the European Union.

Simultaneously, the digital revolution was transforming society. The proliferation of the internet and mobile technology began reshaping daily life. This shift not only revolutionized industries but also connected individuals globally, setting the stage for the information age.

- What did Gorbachev really think while he was weakening communism yet still adhering to it?
- What are similarities and differences between how defeating communism happened across Europe and why it was different across Europe?
- How did Orban transform from fierce anti-communist advocate in the 1980s to a leader with autocratic tendencies in modern Hungary?

### Creation of EU
The film gives a comical yet depressing view on the bureaucracy and regulations in European government. Generally, the episode is about an administrative assistant who's working on a law about cutting off fish fins. There are some difficulties in getting this bill passed, and the assistant works on writing amendments and meets new people. Through the lens of the assistant, a number of crazy things about the EU are revealed. The assistant is shocked to know about regulations! The amount of effort and regulations in getting this bill passed seems disproportionately large for something as seemingly trivial as this, with a minimum of twenty amendments. And, Mr. Speklin tries comically hard to not have to deal with the amendments.

Another strand in this episode is about Brexit. The woman seems very stressed, possibly because she might lose her job. The woman also is not nice to the assistant. We get to see how stressed she is about her work when she is back at home. The message seems to be about how Brexit caused people a lot of stress.

Other observations are they talk about chairs looking like tractor chairs, which is unclear to me what that means. The episode portrayed various political parties by stereotypes, like liberal democrats as a group of woman traders, and communists as from east germany, and the right-leaning people from Bavaria I think. Moreover, the woman pokes fun at the assistant for not being able to find housing, which is symptomatic of a larger problem of European stagnation and increasing costs for young people.

The readings gave me the impression that the European government is overall quite similar to the US's government. The US has three branches and so does the EU. A slight difference would be that the US has the house and senate, whereas the European Parliament seems to be like the house. Europe also has the Council of Europe which is a different entity. In both the US and Europe, it's really hard to get anything done.

- Does the US or EU have a more difficult time getting things done and why?
- What actually happened in the film?
- Why was the person so depressed he has a Seneca statue and contemplated suicide?

### Economics of EU

The Eurozone established a single currency and monetary policy (managed by the European Central Bank, ECB), but each country retained independent fiscal policies, meaning each country controlled its own budgets, spending, and taxation. Greece's hardships are an interesting piece of history. It seems Greece lied about their debt levels in order to join the Eurozone. They were in a lot of debt because of widespread tax evasion and high public spending. Moreover, Greece loss its ability to control its currency, so previously Greece could devalue its own currency, making exports cheaper and more competitive, which could help balance deficits and stimulate the economy. Now, Greece had to resort to austerity, which was a combination of slashing taxes, decreasing public spending, and reforms. This led to widespread unrest and a deepening recession. It feels like a tragedy that the once dominant nation of Greece which was such a prominent civilization in the past is now is in so much trouble.

The North-South divide in Europe is a major issue for the Eurozone. It sort of reminds me of the Civil War, with the Northern and Southern states having different development levels and economies. The North felt the South was a burden, and the Southern countries enjoyed more spending and did not want to resort to austerity.

It wasn't just Greece but a lot of countries seemed to be struggling. This seems like a natural consequence of the differences between different countries and the broader global financial crisis. Moreover, it seemed the lack of a unified fiscal policy and effective crisis management mechanisms left the Eurozone ill-prepared for managing the crisis. To prevent similar situations, the European stability mechanism in 2012 provided emergency funds to loan countries and support for banks.

What is the whole incentive for Northern countries to be part of the Eurozone with Southern countries, especially the most struggling ones like Greece?
What caused Greece's decline from being a top nation in the past to where it is now?
How did the European stability mechanism work?

- Devaluate currency when under lots of debt, but being in Eurozone prevents that.
- Greece crisis post 2008, the IMF & European Commision had to bail them out. Greek people did tax evasion. Austerity means people pay more taxes to cover debt. Greece lied about its debt. Protests organized on Social Media.

### Language, Culture
Most Europeans support multilingualism. There are people who disagree with "everyone in the EU should be able to speak at least one language in addition to their mother toungue", "regional and minority languages should be protected", "improving language skills should be a policy priority", "everyone in the EU should be able to speak more than one language in addition to their mother toungue". The younger Europeans are increasing their number of languages at least two. It's crazy almost half of Europeans can have a conversation in English as a foreign language. Also, the language of Italian is only 3%, while languages like Norwegian or Russian or Dutch or Irish are less than 3%, which seems interesting.

Looking at the bill about establishing a Capital of Culture, there's so much going on in this law, and it reminds me of last week' episode about the EU. There are many rules. An interesting one would be the number of cities holding the title in a year does not exceed 3. Also, there is a Melina Mercouri prize established in Greece that recognizes outstanding efforts to protect and manage cultural landscapes. The paper argues that the European dimension is not emphasized enough, and instead the program is more about boosting the economy of an individual/local culture. This diverged from from the original idea conceived in the 1980s by Mercouri to give Europe a "soul"; the EEC was purely economic. For instance, we see cities like Dublin, Antwerp, etc ... become Capitals of Culture, and they were selected to help these regions develop more, not really to promote overall European culture. There even is a concern that selecting "weak" cities would endanger the reputation of the program, as with Linz in 2008, with people still not really caring after it was selected. It is interesting to see the 2004 Palmer reports having little mention of "multiculturalism" suggesting the conclusion. It is also interesting to see the successful aspects of several modern Capitals of culture, like Liverpool representing the dark side of European colonialism, Linz reflecting the dark side of Hitler, and Marseille representing migration.

- What are the best examples of Capitals of Cultures that really achieved the mission?
- Why is French more common than German though Germany has slightly larger population?
- How has the Capital of Culture program evolved over time in response to feedback?

- 250 languages in europe. 
- Football unites Europeans together. Football club teams are full of people from different areas.
- "High culture" is like art, philosophy, ancient greek/rome; "low culture" is soccer

### Food

On November 17, Biden authorized the use of long-range missiles inside Russia given that Russia started receiving help from North Korean troops. Ukraine would likely target airfields, ammunition depots, and command posts. Biden imposed the constraint because the Pentagon had limited stocks of the missiles, called ATACMS, that were needed for war against other adversaries like North Korea. Also in September the Pentagon said that 90% of Russian jets launching glide bombs had moved east out of range of ATACMS. Also, there is a risk of escalation, since Putin said that the use of "Western missiles" in Russia would constitute direct involvement in the war. The history of this is that the US gave Ukraine HIMARS rocket launchers in summer 2022 with shorter-range GPS-guided rockets, and in late 2023 relented and gave the 300km-range ATACMS to Ukraine to help it strike Russia-occupied Crimea. Ukraine argued that there are more than enough ATACMS, more than 1000, in US's inventory, and the key targets of depots, command posts, logistic hubs, helicopters, attack aircraft are still in range. Moreover, Putin did nothing too bad in response to Crimea rocket attacks even though he considers Crimea to be a part of Russia. Britain and France also have advanced cruise missiles called Storm Shadow and SCALP, and now that the US has relented they are also likely to relent. This in turn might pressure Olaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor, to consider his refusal to provide Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Scholz has been attacked by his competitor Friedrich Merz, head of opposition center-right Christian Democrats. It seems that nuclear war should not happen because Russia is not close to collapsing, but Russia would respond to this by expanding aid to Houthis in Yemen and spies would intensify. Given Trump's closeness with Putin and planned isolationism, I'd expect a peace deal to be reached during Trump's presidency and am hopeful something drastic like nuclear war wouldn't happen in the two months in between now and then.

On the topic of food, it seems Europe has some strict, pedantic regulations. I was surprised that Irish chocolate had been banned from being exported from other European companies, and it's great that this ban got lifted in 2000 after 20 years. This seems a bit wild to me. The supposed reason is that chocolate produced in Ireland, as well as Britain, Denmark, and Finland, contains up to 5% vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter. Also, the fact that the Miller High Life "Champagne of Beers" beers got prevented from being imported by Belgian customs when the Comite Champagne asked for the destruction of 2352 cans on the grounds that the motto infringes the protected destination of origin "Champagne". The company has been using the name for over 40 years, and it is wild that these bottles being crushed is news in 2023. On a slightly different note, the EU trademarks has permitted a German firm to use the name "Fucking Hell" for a new beer though there exists an Austrian village called Fucking. This is quite interesting because Europeans enjoy censoring offensive things.

- Why did Biden authorize strikes though it could escalate to WWIII?
- What really is chocolate and do common American brands fit in with the European definition?
- Why is there an Austrian city named "Fucking" and what is the origin of that word?

I found the link between immigration and Euroscepticism to be interesting. The Schengen system is such an integral part of the EU and enables easy immigration of non-Europeans into various countries. Various countries had disagreements over apportionment of immigrants during the refugee crisis. I found the paper's rigorous analysis of the relationship between perceptions on immigration and Euroscepticism to be instructive, since they account for confounders like education, unemployment, perceived economic situation, political interest, satisfaction with democracy, political ideology, urban or rural residency, gender, and age. It does make sense that increased education leads to lower Euroscepticism for so many reasons. I think this is similar to how more educated people in America tend to lean left. The analysis of the impact of gender on Euroscepticism reveals either that woman are more Eurosceptic than men or that results are inconclusive. This surprises me because woman tend to lean more left, and more left-leaning people tend to be less Eurosceptic due to having a more welcoming, educated, and cosmopolitan mindset. Another surprising trend seems to be how Europeans are roughly 50% divided on whether immigrants make country a worse place. The fact that this number is so close to 50% seems intriguing and makes immigration a very partisan issue. Even though there's 11 features, the Rsquared is only at most 0.16 which seems quite low. It is interesting because these 11 features include features I'd expect to be very salient predictors, such as political ideology, since the left and right seem to be divided on the immigration issue. Therefore, most voters in both the left and right probably lean center.

On another note, the film I watched *My Beautiful Laundrette* was not as good as the films I am used to watching. It was from 1985, but more than that, I felt it was not very exciting. The events in the film were very predictable and standardâ€”racism against immigrants from Pakistan in the UK, together with a homosexual relationship that was considered taboo at the times. The relationship between Omar and Johnny is not well-developed because there is no development of what caused them to fall in love in the past, which is quite disappointing. 

- What is the significance of Omar's father Hussein in My Beautiful Laundrette being left-leaning, and what are the dominant politics in Pakistan and UK at the time?
- Why are there no flashbacks to scenes involving Omar and Johnny in the past, and Johnny's past racist actions, and the characters only talk about it?
