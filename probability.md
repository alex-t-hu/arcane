>measure space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ 
>- state space or outcome space is nonempty set
>- measurable subsets or events is a $\sigma$-field or $\sigma$-algebra over $\Omega$ . It's a nonempty collection of subsets of $\Omega$ closed under complementation and countable union.
>- measure is a map $\mathcal{F}\rightarrow \left[ 0, \infty \right]$ which is not infinite everywhere and countably additive
>Borel $\sigma$-field $\mathcal{B}_{\mathbb{R}}$ is smallest $\sigma$-field over $\mathbb{R}$ containing $\mathcal{I}$, the set of all open intervals on $\mathbb{R}$
